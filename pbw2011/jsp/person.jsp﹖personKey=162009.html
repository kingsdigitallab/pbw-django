<li><label>(Unspecified) <var>(null)</var><li><label>Narrative <var>(20)</var><dl></dl></li><li><label>Authorship <var>(14)</var><dl><dt> After Dorylaion, he emphasised problems of the journey to Antioch in Pisidia and Ikonion: thirst, from which men and women died; hunger, for fertile Romania was devastated by the Turks; the lack of pack animals, leading to the use of pigs, goats etc.; and the great confusion of languages, despite the one purpose&nbsp;</dt> <dd>&nbsp; Fulcher of Chartres&nbsp;1.12.6-1.13.5&nbsp;</dd><dt> After the third battle of Ramla, he made a full statement of writerly humility, including a strong implication that a more learned man was checking the Latin of his history&nbsp;</dt> <dd>&nbsp; Fulcher of Chartres&nbsp;2.34.1-2&nbsp;</dd><dt> As <a class="s02 x99" href="person.jsp%EF%B9%96personKey=156236.html" title="Baldwin of Bourcq, Baldwin II, king of Jerusalem" >Baldwin 52</a> assumed the regency of Antioch after the Field of Blood and the second battle of Danith, Fulcher urged him to use his new powers well: this suggests that the passage was not written long after the event&nbsp;</dt> <dd>moneo ergo regem et quaeso ....&nbsp;&nbsp; Fulcher of Chartres&nbsp;3.7.2&nbsp;</dd><dt> As he left the army before the siege of Antioch (though he visited the city later), his account of the siege is very unspecific before its climax, with few names; even the climax is described in a very general way&nbsp;</dt> <dd>&nbsp; Fulcher of Chartres&nbsp;1.16.1-1.24.8&nbsp;</dd><dt> By the time of <a class="s02 x99" href="person.jsp%EF%B9%96personKey=106858.html" title="Bohemond of Taranto" >Bohemond 61</a>'s assault in 1107, Fulcher shows complete acceptance of the propaganda Bohemond had spread about Alexios, saying that the latter had treated crusaders and pilgrims cruelly and thwarted them&nbsp;</dt> <dd>&nbsp; Fulcher of Chartres&nbsp;2.38.3&nbsp;</dd><dt> He continued to emphasise the moral dimension of the Field of Blood by the probably apocryphal story of <a class="s02 x99" href="person.jsp%EF%B9%96personKey=162026.html" title="Turkish-speaking Frankish kinght (from a moral story)" >Anonymus 866</a> and <a class="s02 x99" href="person.jsp%EF%B9%96personKey=162027.html" title="Turkish critic of Christian morality (from a moral story)" >Anonymus 867</a>&nbsp;</dt> <dd>&nbsp; Fulcher of Chartres&nbsp;3.4.4&nbsp;</dd><dt> He explicitly claims to have been a member of the First Crusade, and that his history has the status of a careful eyewitness account&nbsp;</dt> <dd>... ego Fulcherus Carnotensis cum ceteris iens peregrinis, postea, sicut oculis meis perspexi, diligenter et sollicite in memoriam posteris collegi.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fulcher of Chartres&nbsp;1.5.12&nbsp;</dd><dt> He made extremely intelligent comments about the impossibility of reaching accurate casualty figures for the battles he was narrating&nbsp;</dt> <dd>De numero autem occisorum vel sauciatorum comprehendi veritas nec in hoc nec in alio quolibet bello potest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fulcher of Chartres&nbsp;3.43.1-4&nbsp;</dd><dt> He narrated the battle of Dorylaion from a restricted point of view - a soldier in the first division of the army unaware why the other half of the crusade had disappeared; his narration is desperate, expecting death and confessing sins till the second division providentially appeared to win the battle&nbsp;</dt> <dd>&nbsp; Fulcher of Chartres&nbsp;1.11.1-1.12-6&nbsp;</dd><dt> He narrated the journey from France to Nicaea from the point of view of a member of the contingent of <a class="s02 x99" href="person.jsp%EF%B9%96personKey=156441.html" title="Stephen, count of Chartres and Blois" >Stephanos 4001</a>, attached to the larger group of <a class="s02 x99" href="person.jsp%EF%B9%96personKey=156421.html" title="Robert [Curthose], count [duke] of Normandy" >Robert 63</a>&nbsp;</dt> <dd>&nbsp; Fulcher of Chartres&nbsp;1.6.1-1.10.1&nbsp;</dd><dt> He pondered the differences that residence in the east had made to western crusaders: in the race of marriage partners, mixture of language, local loyalties and socio-economic position&nbsp;</dt> <dd>&nbsp; Fulcher of Chartres&nbsp;3.37.1-8&nbsp;</dd><dt> He revised his first version of the  Historia Hierosolymitana in 1118-1120, adding the prologue and a necrology of <a class="s02 x99" href="person.jsp%EF%B9%96personKey=156235.html" title="Baldwin of Boulogne, Baldwin I, king of Jerusalem" >Baldwin 51</a>; the prologue is conventional, claiming as an eyewitness that the deeds of the crusaders and their martyrdom should not be forgotten, and would inspire the next generation&nbsp;</dt> <dd>&nbsp; Fulcher of Chartres&nbsp;Prologus 1.1-5, 2.64.7&nbsp;</dd><dt> He twice criticised <a class="s02 x99" href="person.jsp%EF%B9%96personKey=156235.html" title="Baldwin of Boulogne, Baldwin I, king of Jerusalem" >Baldwin 51</a> quite sharply for his rashness at the second battle of Ramla; he should have waited for reinforcements and the True Cross; did the king know of this comment by his chaplain?&nbsp;</dt> <dd>immodestia regis magna fuit ... sunt nonnulli plus in virtute sua quam in Domino confidentes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fulcher of Chartres&nbsp;2.18.5, 2.21.15-18&nbsp;</dd><dt>He was impressed by the order shown by swarms of locusts, and interpreted them as condemnation of public morality&nbsp;</dt> <dd>&nbsp; Fulcher of Chartres&nbsp;60.2-5&nbsp;</dd></dl></li><li><label>Death <var>(null)</var><li><label>Description <var>(1)</var><dl><dt>He declares himself 65 years old in autumn 1123&nbsp;</dt> <dd>tredecimum complens ... lustrum.&nbsp;&nbsp;
